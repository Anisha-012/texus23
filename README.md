Hackathon project on enhancement of disaster response and recovery effects 

6. HitchHiker’s Pub
Team: Saviours of the reality


This is a website where basically we will cover the following points which
would reduce the carbon footprints of individuals for encouraging sustainable
transportation choices:


1. With the help of tracking of one’s location, the website would
suggest the nearby people(radius <= 5km), using either the same
route or having a destination that is covered by the route, to
contact the car owner for the carpooling purpose via SMS using
AWS SNS Services or through the chat services on the website.

2. By integrating google maps,the car owner of the driver would be
suggested to use the most efficient and the viable shortest route
resulting in lesser carbon emissions.

3. All the services would be shown and their respective elements
(including money saved, reduced carbon emissions and rewards
earned) would be compared which would help the user choose
his best choice.

4. One would be able to target their progress in terms of reducing
carbon emissions and receive redeemable rewards on the basis
of their consistency that would motivate them to follow the
process.

5. Last but not the least, one can donate or participate in different
environmental projects and events that would be displayed to
them with details. That would also help them earn rewards.
We will be looking forward to bring a change in the environment by the above
steps in the most interactive, user friendly and impactful way.
